Dynamic Programming
It is a way or method of solving complex problem in efficient way in term of time and space. 
We may say this is an optimized version of Divide and Conquer also, 
in Divide and Conquer we devide problem in to sub-problems and solve the sub-problem to get result 
but in DP we think same devide problem into sub-problems but here we remember the solution of sub-problem
so that we can use if same sub-problem need to be solved throught the process.
